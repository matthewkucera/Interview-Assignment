I have update the project to use inheritance with the different items for purchase.

I used single table inheritance, I am not really sure if this was the best route for the long term.  But as of now it seems to work fine.  I added another store item, blanket, and it was fairly easy to do.  So, adding more items to the store with different behaviors should not be that difficult.  As of now the items each have one different field that separates them(author, material, membership_type) and the purchase method calls different mailer methods.

I tried to set up email notifications for send out packing slips and notify the user of their order, I never got anything to actually show up in my email.  I followed some online tutorials and tried to look at the API to figure out what I was doing wrong and I couldn't quite figure it out.  That being said, I never got to do validation on the email address and regular sending address.  I made a regex to validate the email([^@]+@[\w]+.[\w]{2,4}) but never used it.
